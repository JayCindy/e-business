# e-business-store
These documents are part of my semester long e-commerce project. We were asked to created an e-store, but before building we had to go through the steps
of determining our product, audience, relm of the products, how to advertise, privacy policies, analytics, and more!
Each document contains different steps of the projects, ending with the last document containing a link to the final product (which can also be found here: https://tolkientreasures.my-online.store/).
